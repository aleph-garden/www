  <h1>Aleph Garden</h1>
  <p class="lede">Aleph Garden is my workshop for one mechanism: a resource has an address, a table of rules picks the code that draws it, and you replace that code without building an application around it.</p>
  <p>I am <a href="https://github.com/tophcodes" target="_top">Christopher M&uuml;hl</a> and I work on it in the open, in pieces.</p>
  <p>This page is the mechanism running. A rule matched the address <code>${here}</code>, named a view, and that view returned the markup you are reading. There is no page behind it. Change the row and this page draws differently.</p>
  <p>The same table decides the rest. Put an IRI after <code>${here}-/</code> and the rules pick a view for whatever is at that address: a note as a note, a container as a listing, a graph as a table of statements. The addresses are IRIs and the data underneath is RDF, so a rule can say "anything of this type" and have the type mean the same thing in my store and in yours.</p>
  <p>Vitrine is the part that draws. It reads and never writes, so editing and permissions stay with the tools that already do them.</p>
  <p class="next"><a href="/vitrine/docs/" target="_top">Read the Vitrine documentation</a> <a href="/vitrine/docs/run/install/" target="_top">Clone it and build it</a> <a href="https://github.com/aleph-garden/vocab" target="_top">The vocabularies</a></p>

  <h2>What is in the lab</h2>
  <p class="caveat">Nine repositories. The counts and dates were measured on 2026-09-22 from each repository's own history. Four are public and linked; the other five are private today, so their numbers are mine to assert and yours to discount.</p>
  <table class="lab">
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Repository</th><th>What it is</th><th>Activity</th><th>Source</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      ${LAB.map(row).join('\n      ')}
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p class="caveat">There is no maturity column, on purpose. Six labels are defined for this lab and each carries a test someone else can run without asking me. The one that decides whether a repository is worth your afternoon is Buildable: clone it, follow the README's own commands from a clean checkout, reach what the README promises. Nobody has run that test this quarter for any row above, so no row carries a label. What that costs you: for every repository here, you find out by cloning it.</p>
