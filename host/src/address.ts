// aleph.garden opens any IRI, so a location has to carry one that is not its
// own. It goes behind a reserved first segment:
//
//   https://aleph.garden/-/https://pod.example/notes/a.md
//
// The segment, rather than the IRI's scheme, is what marks a viewer location.
// The routing that picks between the host and a static file then tests one
// segment, a path naming no IRI is a plain 404, and a subject under `urn:`,
// `did:` or `tag:` is addressable without an allowlist of schemes.
//
// The IRI stays unencoded, so that a reader can read it and copy it out.
